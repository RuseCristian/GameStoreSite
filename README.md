Welcome to GameStoreSite! This is an online game store that I developed in collaboration with my colleague, Andrei Feraru, as part of our Internet and Web Programming class.

GameStoreSite offers a fully dynamic store page that generates games displayed based on the data stored in the database. The website includes essential features such as a shopping cart, user registration and login, and an admin page that is accessible only to admin accounts. The admin page offers a graphical user interface (GUI) that enables administrators to add new games to the store.

If you would like to explore this project, we recommend using XAMPP to create a local server, an open-source, cross-platform web server solution that is easy to install and use.
