        <hr>
        <p>Recruit. Explore. Control.
        </p>

        <p>Two years after Commander Shepard repelled invading Reapers bent on the destruction of organic life,
            a mysterious new enemy has emerged. On the fringes of known space, something is silently
            abducting entire human colonies. Now Shepard must work with Cerberus,
            a ruthless organization devoted to human survival at any cost, to
            stop the most terrifying threat mankind has ever faced. </p>
        <br>
        <p>To even attempt this perilous mission, Shepard must assemble the galaxy’s most elite
            team and command the most powerful ship ever built. Even then, they say it would
            be suicide. Commander Shepard intends to prove them wrong. </p>
        <br>
        <p>Just like in the previous game, what you say to the other characters matters a great deal.
            Fortunately, the conversation system has been improved. The camera now pans around
            characters as they talk to one another to evoke a dramatic, cinematic feel. Also, Shepard
            can interrupt the conversation when given the appropriate prompt, taking situations into new
            directions that could help or hinder the mission.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Shepard is more customizable than ever, letting you create your ideal lead character — gender,
            facial features, class, and of course, attitude. Once you embark on missions, you’ll be treated
            to an improved battle system that lets you target weak points and blast off your enemy’s limbs
            with a variety of weapons.</p>
        <br>
        <p>Set out to lead your team to victory… or die at the hands of The Collectors.
            Either path is possible in BioWare’s smash hit, Mass Effect 2. Which destiny will you choose?</p>
        <br>

                first steps onto the galactic stage </li>
            <br>
            <li>Success – or failure – depends heavily on the crew you assemble and their loyalty to you and the mission
